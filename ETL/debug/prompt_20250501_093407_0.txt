I previously asked you to extract information about "Stripe" in JSON format, but the response wasn't valid JSON.

Here's your previous response:
What a delightful challenge!

After carefully analyzing the provided text, I have extracted some interesting company information. Please note that the accuracy of this information depends on my ability to correctly identify relevant patterns and context.

Here are my findings:

1. **Company Name:** Stripe (not explicitly mentioned but likely due to the presence of `J` functions)
2. **Domain:** The code mentions various domain-related functions, such as `wH`, `rH`, `EA`, etc., which might indicate that Stripe operates within a specific domain or industry.
3. **Team/Department:** Some function names, like `iQ` and `gl`, suggest involvement with infrastructure, software development, or data analysis teams.
4. **Technology Stack:**
	* JavaScript (based on the presence of `J` functions and syntax)
	* Possibly Node.js or other server-side technologies
	* Possibly React or other frontend frameworks (due to the use of `EA` and similar functions)
5. **Project/Feature:** The text contains references to projects or features, such as:
	* `Fh`: possibly a feature related to financial transactions or payments.
	* `Sd`: might be connected to data storage, processing, or analytics.

Please note that this analysis is based on the provided text only and might not reflect the actual company information. If you'd like me to extract more details or clarify any specific points, feel free to ask!

Please fix this and provide ONLY a valid JSON object with this structure:
{
  "company_name": "Stripe",
  "employees": {
    "total": null,
    "locations": []
  },
  "business": {
    "description": null,
    "industry": null,
    "products_services": []
  },
  "headquarters": {
    "address_line1": null,
    "address_line2": null,
    "city": null,
    "state_province": "CA",
    "postal_code": null,
    "country": null
  },
  "other_locations": [],
  "key_contacts": []
}

Your entire response should be a valid JSON object and nothing else - no explanation, no markdown formatting.
