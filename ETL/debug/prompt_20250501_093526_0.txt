I previously asked you to extract information about "Snowflake Inc." in JSON format, but the response wasn't valid JSON.

Here's your previous response:
The joys of extracting company information from web content!

After carefully analyzing the provided text, I was able to extract some interesting details:

1. **Company Name**: The company name is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, based on the context and the fact that it's a JavaScript code, I'm going to take a educated guess that the company might be related to Snow (as the first few lines of the code mention "Snow" repeatedly).
2. **Industry/Field**: The code doesn't explicitly mention the industry or field, but given the presence of Snow and terms like "Submit", "Dispose", and "VR", I'm inclined to believe that this company might be operating in the e-commerce or gaming space.
3. **Technology Stack**: The code is written in JavaScript, which suggests that the company might be using a web-based technology stack (e.g., Node.js, React, Angular). There's also mention of "MQ" and "O", which could indicate the use of message queues like RabbitMQ or Oracle's AQ.
4. **Key Features**: The code contains several mentions of "Submit", "Dispose", and "VR" (Virtual Reality), which might suggest that this company is developing a VR-related application or platform.
5. **Product/Service**: Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the provided text to pinpoint a specific product or service offered by this company.

Please note that these inferences are based on my analysis of the provided text and might not be 100% accurate. If you'd like me to extract more information from the code or provide further insights, feel free to ask!

Please fix this and provide ONLY a valid JSON object with this structure:
{
  "company_name": "Snowflake Inc.",
  "employees": {
    "total": null,
    "locations": []
  },
  "business": {
    "description": null,
    "industry": null,
    "products_services": []
  },
  "headquarters": {
    "address_line1": null,
    "address_line2": null,
    "city": null,
    "state_province": "CA",
    "postal_code": null,
    "country": null
  },
  "other_locations": [],
  "key_contacts": []
}

Your entire response should be a valid JSON object and nothing else - no explanation, no markdown formatting.
