I previously asked you to extract information about "Palantir Technologies" in JSON format, but the response wasn't valid JSON.

Here's your previous response:
What a lovely piece of JavaScript code!

After carefully analyzing this text, I've extracted some company information:

1. **Company Name**: The code doesn't explicitly mention the company name. However, based on the context and the coding style, it appears to be related to a well-known technology company.
2. **Project or Product**: The code seems to be part of a project or product that deals with web development, possibly an open-source library or framework. Some of the functions and variables suggest involvement in user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design.

Please fix this and provide ONLY a valid JSON object with this structure:
{
  "company_name": "Palantir Technologies",
  "employees": {
    "total": null,
    "locations": []
  },
  "business": {
    "description": null,
    "industry": null,
    "products_services": []
  },
  "headquarters": {
    "address_line1": null,
    "address_line2": null,
    "city": null,
    "state_province": "CO",
    "postal_code": null,
    "country": null
  },
  "other_locations": [],
  "key_contacts": []
}

Your entire response should be a valid JSON object and nothing else - no explanation, no markdown formatting.
